*Custom Directive is a user defined directive 
Using this directive we can add user defined styles  to single dom element and multiple dom elements unlike a normal attribute directive 
where we can add only a style to single dom element
=>using slector of this component as an attribute in dom element 
=>this component class gets intialized and it's constructor gets called and after reference of that particular dom element is passed as an 
instance to the property element and using that property element we can add styling to dom element */

rederer 2 class is an abstract or  a bridge between DOM and component code

In professional we should not manipulate the data directly using like custom directive and reference elements
 so using renderer we can set perform many operations on the dom elements but no directly
 we can add styliing to the data and add attributes child elements set values and we can perform many operations to the dom elements.

Host Listener listens to events on the host element(div element on which custom attribute directive is applied)\
 and excutes the event handlers(methods which executes the events to which event handler listens).


 HostBinding is used to bind the properties of reference element of a DOM(properties of DOM on which directive class selector is used)
 with the properties of Directive class or a component class.

 =>using @HostBinding decorator we can bind the properties in Directive class with Properties of a Dom element and modifications ,
 styles to the properties in the dom element.
